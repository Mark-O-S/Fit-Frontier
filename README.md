## Features

### Navbar

The navigation bar is the core navigation for the site. It is present throughout the whole website. There's a slight change between mobile size and desktop, however, all include the same functions.

Desktop:

![Desktop Nav](/media/desktop-nav-bar.png)

When a user is logged in, an whishlist icon is present for users to add product to their personal product wishlist.

![Desktop Nav 1](/media/desktop-navbar.png)

Clicking the Shop button on the navbar opens a drop down where you can browse the following categories:
 - Dumbbells
 - Barbells
 - Kettle Bells
 - Weight Plates
 - New
 - On Sale
 - All Equipments

![Desktop Nav 2](/media/desktop-navbar-2.png)

Clicking the "My Account" button on the navbar opens a dropdown menu that allows a user to click a link to take them to either the registration or login page.

![Desktop Nav 3](/media/desktop-navbar-3.png)

View if a registered user has an item(s) in their wish list and basket

### Footer

The footer section, like the navbar, is present throughout the website. It allows users to subscribe to the company newsletters, provide social links and also contact details.

Desktop:

![Desktop Footer](/media/desktop-footer.png)

Mobile:

![Mobile Footer](/media/mobile-footer.png)

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### Home Page

The home page is the first page on which a user lands on. For this reason, it has to have a clearly defined purpose and be easy to navigate. The page will also be used to promote the shop and its products.

To make the site's purpose more apparent, I have included the product categories with images so that the users can visually see that the business sells gym equipments.

Desktop:

![Home Page Hero](/media/desktop-homepage-1.png)

Mobile:

![Mobile Home Page Hero](/media/mobile-homepage-1.png)

![Mobile Home Page](/media/mobile-homepage-2.png)
![Mobile Home Page](/media/mobile-homepage-3.png)

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### Products Page

The product page is where the user will visit to browse products and add them to the cart. Registered users will also have the option to add products to their wishlist. It is also where users will go when they filter the products by category. The user can navigate between pages using the pagination buttons at the bottom of the page.

On the individual product details, the user can see the product name, price, image, and category. The user can accessing the product details page by clicking on the product card. In the product details page the user can choose quantities and color options where available.

Products page view & Product detail view:

Desktop View

![Desktop Product 1](/media/desktop-product-1.png)

Mobile View on all products page

![Desktop Product Detail](/media/mobile-product-view-1.png)

Mobile View on an individual product

![Mobile Product Detail 1](/media/mobile-product-detail-1.png)

I created a review section underneath the product detail so that users are able to see individual product reviews.

Only registered users will have the option to create a review. Everyone can see a review.

![Desktop Product Review](/media/desktop-product-review-2.png)
![Desktop Product No Review](/media/desktop-product-review-1.png)

![Mobile Proudct Review](/media/mobile-product-review-1.png)

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### User Registration

To register, a user must navigate to the account section on the top right corner of the nav bar and click "My Account". There will be a drop down button to give the user the option to register or login.

When the user clicks register, they will be directed to the sign up page in which email address, username and password will be asked for and required in order to sign up. 

When the user completes this, an email confirmation will be sent to the users email address in which they need to follow in order to complete the sign up process.

![User registration](/media/user-registration.png)

A message will appear requasting the user to check email and follow the link to finalize the signup process.
![Verify email](/media/verify-email-message.png)
![Verify email link](/media/verify-email-link-message.png)

The user must then confirm the email address.

![Verify email btn](/media/verify-email-link-btn.png)

Once confirming, a success box will appear on the top right of the screen to inform the user that it is a success.

![Verify email success](/media/verify-email-success.png)

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### User profile

Once a user is registered and logged in, they will be able to visit their profile page which can be accessed from the main nav bar.

In their profile, they will be able to add or update their delivery information details and view their order history if they have previously purchased items while logged in.

![Empty info](/media/user-profile-page-info-empty.png)
![Filled info](/media/user-profile-page-info-filled.png)

View of Order History once they make a purchase.

![Order history](/media/order-history.png)

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### Purchasing a product

When a user add's a product into their bag, they will be able to then go to their bag and check out.

![Shopping bag 1](/media/shopping-bag-section-filled.png)

View when an item is successfully added into the bag.

![Added product to car](/media/add-item-to-bag-success.png)


After clicking secure checkout, the user is directed to the checkout page where they can finalize delivery information and make a payment

![Checkout section](/media/checkout-section.png)

After confirming checkout process and finalizing payment. The user will be shown if the payment was successful by a message box on the top right, the order receipt will be shown as well as an email confirmation sent to the users email address. 

![checkout success box](/media/checkout-success.png)
![order receipt email](/media/order-receipt-email.png)
![order receipt confirmation](/media/order-receipt-confirmation.png)

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### Error Page

I have included a custom error 404 page in which if triggered, the user will be directed to this site and have the option to navigate back to the home page if a 404 error occurs. This reduces the risk of a user leaving the site completely due to a bad user experience.

![Error 404](/media/error-404-page.png)
![Mobile Error 404](/media/mobile-error-404-page.png)

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### Future Features

- Features I could I could add or improve on  could be a:
- Blog section where customers who previously purchased products could create blog posts about their fitness journey or fitness tips etc. Other users would be able to like or comment in these posts.
- Improve the commenting text box in reviews.
- Overall add further styling to make the user experience more fun.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Search Engine Optimisation

Search Engine Optimisation(SEO) is a set of practices designed to improve the appearance and positioning of web pages in organic search results. To improve my website's visibility on search engines, I started by conducting some keyword research and defining short-tail and long-tail keywords.

[Work tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/) was used to try and narrow the most relevant, these were then included in the website's meta tags.

A [sitemap.xml](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/) and robots.txt file were added to my project. he sitemap lists all the pages on the website, while the robots.txt file tells search engines which pages they should not crawl.

### Social Media Marketing

Building a robust social network with active participation and connecting it to your business website can lead to increased sales.

I've created a Facebook business account wich can be acessed **[here](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61550885970917)**.

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

Back to [top](#table-of-contents)

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:
- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*
